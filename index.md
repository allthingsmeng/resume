##Work Experience    

#### Aug 2015 — Present
### Canyon Market
Since I’ve been familiar with grocery signage back in 2007 and had built a network of signage clients leading to now, it was a smooth transition to be welcomed as a signmaker at Canyon Market. I use several different types of materials and mediums to showcase special events, highlight sale items, and display every day foods. What I want to create with my signs is an experience that shows freshness, craftsmanship, and passion, in the same way our employees / vendors feel about the food they make and represent in the market.

#### Jan 2015 — July 2015
### Wikimedia Foundation
The focus of my design fellowship was working on user interface standardization efforts. It involved detailing on iconography and UI patterns. Focusing on granule parts of projects gave me time to really think about the problem.

#### Mar 2014 — Jul 2014
### TEDP: Tenderloin Economic Development Project
As their Social Media / Marketing Communications Specialist & Graphic Designer, I redesigned their website, logo, took photographs, and maintained their social media networks and online presence. I also served as a community advocate with Mid-Market tech companies and Tenderloin business owners, and in turn successfully developed Tasting the Tenderloin - a series of lunches held at restaurants within the neighborhood. Attendees and sponsors included One Kings Lane, PeerSpace, Spotify, Square, WeWork, and Zendesk.

#### Aug 2012 — Present
### Michelle Meng : Freelance / Independent
Upon graduating college, I have taken on clients to provide freelance design work that vary from identity / branding, animation, and signage.

#### Jun 2011 — Aug 2011
### BLAP Productions
As their junior designer, I helped promote BLAP Productions  by designing flyers for events, editing / watermarking photos as well as handling their social media networks.

#### Sept 2007 — Oct 2011
### Falletti Foods
At Falletti Foods, I gave exceptional customer service as a cashier, stocker and also created signs to highlight sales and menu items.

#### Sept 2009 — Feb 2010
### BAYCAT : Bayview Hunters Point Center for Arts and Technology
I came into BAYCAT with some design knowledge from school but applying projects in real-world situations and on a non-homework basis made all the difference. Under their mentorship, I was able to further my learning and experience by designing logos, flyers, posters, and opening credits for the mini-feature the non-profit was filming at the time.
